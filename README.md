# taskrrrr

version: 1.0.0

Trello like website, not responsive as of now (v1.0.0).

You can drag-drop columns and tasks. You can add new columns, new tasks and even delete columns for now.


Developed using React.js with Typescript

## Motivation
I like strictly typed languages, I believe they are robust and you can find out most of the bugs in development cycle and I've developed my FYP using MEAN Stack so I was aware of the syntax and structure of typescript and how much it helped with code completion motivated me to develop/code this project using typescript and I'll tell you, It is better than plain old javascript!.

## Deployed on Heroku
